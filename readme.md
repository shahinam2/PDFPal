### TL;DR

If you want a CLI based node.js tool which can do any of the following tasks:

1. Convert multiline input to a PDF file.
2. Convert a Text file into a PDF file.
3. Merge multiple PDFs.
4. Split a PDF into separate PDFs.
5. Remove PDF page(s).
6. Convert a PDF to JPG files.
7. Count the number of PDF pages.
8. Zip the files in output directory.
9. Email the PDF file.

Then clone the repo.

make sure that pdfpal.js has execution permissions with `chmod +x ./pdfpal` 

Install the necessary packages with `node install`

and then run `./pdfpal` and choose the number of your desired tool and continue based on instructions.

## ‚Ñπ What is PDFPal?

PDFPal like PayPal is a user-friendly PDF manipulation tool. 

Just like linux commands it does only one thing at a time!

For example: 

1. It can convert multiline input into a PDF. the multiline input can also be more that one page.
2. It can convert a text file into a PDF file and in order to do that you only need to put your PDF file into input folder.
3. It can merge multiple PDF files together. for example you have file1.pdf and file2.pdf and you want to merge them together then you can put your files into input folder and then run PDFPal and enter 2 and press enter. Depending on your file size the operation will take from a few milliseconds up to a few seconds and then file2 will be added to the end of file1 and then the merged file can be fetched from output folder.
4. It can split a PDF into a separate PDFs. which means for example if you give it a 20 page pdf file, it will generate 20 pdf files based on each page file the input pdf into output folder. 
5. It can remove a single page or multiple pages at once.
6. It can convert a pdf file into jpeg file based on the users given range.
7. It can count the number of pages of a pdf file. 
8. After applying any of the PDF manipulation mentioned above, you can use PDFPal to create a zip file based on all of the files inside the output folder.
9. And at last you can send any file located in output folder to any email address.

### ü§î Inspiration:

Actually PDFPal is my project, when DCI‚Äôs Programming basics module was over. I always wanted to create a tool which can work with files and after some research, while I‚Äôm a fan of [ilovepdf.com](http://ilovepdf.com) website, I thought why not create a trimmed down, CLI version of ilovepdf!

### üéØ PDFPal Project's Aim/Status:

At the time of writting this readme I‚Äôm at the end of 3rd module of DCI‚Äôs one year web development bootcamp which was all about javascript and node.js and everything in this module was CLI based. In the upcoming module we are going to learn about react. which is module 4. which module 4 is over I‚Äôm going to create a GUI for PDFPal.

After module 5 I‚Äôm going to add authentication, database, self-host and dockerize PDFPal.
